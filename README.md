# DNote
This is a basic level note keeping software named DNote. This software is build by Nazmus Sadat using Android studio. 
This is an Androied project. This project is very simple and beginner level androied project. 
I think this project will be helpful for learning much about creating a Note Keeping software for them who are learning and beginner at Android development.
In this project there are five or more activity page which is containing all graphical representation and background codes of the app.
In this project I used SQLite database for saving the notes. 
And the database is create on local storage after opening the app for the first time. The database is used for saving all the notes which are saved in this app.
This project is very simple,easy and basic level Android studio project.
